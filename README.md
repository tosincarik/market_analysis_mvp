ðŸ“Š Market Analysis Dashboard â€“ MVP
Overview

The Market Analysis Dashboard is an MVP designed to provide actionable insights on global stock and cryptocurrency markets. Leveraging modern data engineering, multi-agent frameworks, and large language models (LLMs), the dashboard harmonizes diverse datasets to deliver trends, sentiment, and market signals in a single, intuitive interface.

Aim & Goals

Aim:
To build a scalable, local-market MVP that allows users to monitor and analyze financial markets in real time, combining quantitative data with AI-powered qualitative insights.

Key Goals:

Integrate multiple financial data sources (stocks, crypto) seamlessly.

Apply multi-agent frameworks for automated data retrieval, sentiment analysis, and trend detection.

Harmonize quantitative and qualitative data to produce actionable insights.

Provide a foundation for dashboard visualization and future monetization features.

Novelty

Multi-LLM Harmonization: Uses multiple large language models to summarize and interpret market data, enabling richer insights than simple numeric analysis.

Hybrid Quantitative & Qualitative Approach: Combines structured market data with unstructured news and sentiment analysis for a 360Â° market view.

Fully Local & Modular: Runs entirely on local infrastructure (Python + SQL Server), allowing iterative development and easy adaptation for future cloud deployment.

Extensible Architecture: Designed to integrate additional agents, new data sources, or predictive analytics seamlessly.

Techniques & Frameworks

Data Handling: Python, Pandas, SQL Server / SSMS for robust, normalized data storage.

Data Retrieval: Yahoo Finance API (stocks) and CoinGecko API (crypto).

Multi-Agent Orchestration: LangChain / CrewAI (local setup) to automate data processing, sentiment analysis, and insight generation.

LLM Processing: OpenAI GPT-family models for summarization, harmonization, and sentiment scoring.

Visualization (Phase 2): Streamlit or React for dynamic dashboards with trend charts, volatility, and alerting.

Analysis Techniques: Trend detection, volatility measurement, sentiment scoring, and harmonized insight generation.
